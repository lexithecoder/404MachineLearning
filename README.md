Group 8: 
Wine classification 


## Step 5 Report Summary ##
 Train: From the total wine dataset (red and white wine). The train size was 20%. 
 Test:  From the total wine dataset (red and white wine).The test size was 80%.

**SVM**
We then performed an SVM on the dataset and we got a training accuracy of 43.80%, and our testing accuracy was 43.6%

**Decision Tree**
Initial testing accuracy of 46.96%

**Random Forest**
Initial testing accuracy of 57.48%

**Random Forest With Upsampling**
Initial testing accuracy using original sample of classes of 48.78%
Initial testing accuracy with using upsampled classes of 29.22%

**Random Forest With SMOTE**
Initial testing accuracy using original sample of classes of 78.30%
Initial testing accuracy with using synthetic sample of classes of 62.60%
