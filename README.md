CSE404 Group 8 Intro to Machine Learning Project

Group 8: 
Wine classification 

1- You have done a baseline with SVM

2- Evaluation: Confusion matrix 

3- If this issue is data imbalance? Maybe separate two model one for what and one for red.
3.5- Deal data imbalance. Upsampling or weighting the loss

4- Apply other classic learning: Decisions trees, random forest => explore your library can quantize the data for you. 

5- Feature analysis: what features are important, Ablation: remove each feature. Depending on your model:  for example check weights. Level of the features in DT, e.g. if it is in the root. 

6- PyTorch: see if it is competitive or not.    

7- Error analysis.
